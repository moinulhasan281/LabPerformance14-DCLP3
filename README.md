Random Digit List Generator
Welcome to this simple yet fun little Python script!
It generates a list of random single-digit numbers where the first two numbers always add up to a target value you choose, and the rest are completely random. Great for practicing list manipulation, random number generation, and input validation in Python.

✨ What Does This Program Do?
Imagine you need a list of numbers like this:

The first two numbers should add up to a number you pick (called the target).

The rest of the numbers in the list can be any random digits between 0 and 9.

This program makes that happen.
It also makes sure that the inputs you give make sense, and if not — it politely lets you know with a helpful error message.

🚀 How to Use It
📥 Requirements
Python 3.x
That’s it — no fancy external libraries needed. It uses Python’s built-in random module.

🖥️ Running the Program
To run it, simply open your terminal or command prompt and type:

bash
Copy
Edit
python your_script_name.py
(Replace your_script_name.py with whatever you’ve saved the file as.)

📌 Example Output
When you run the program, you’ll see something like:

bash
Copy
Edit
Case#1 Output: 5 2 7
Case#2 Output: 6 4 3
In these cases:

The sum of the first two numbers equals the target (like 5 + 2 = 7).

The remaining numbers are randomly chosen.

📚 How It Works (Under the Hood)
The main function here is:

generate_list(target, length)
Arguments:

target — the desired sum of the first two numbers.

length — how long you want your list to be (must be at least 2).

Returns:
A list of integers that meets your conditions.

Raises Errors:
If:

The length is less than 2.

No possible pair of single-digit numbers can add up to the given target.

💡 Why This is a Good Practice Project
This script is a neat little exercise for:

Working with lists.

Using random number generation.

Practicing basic error handling.

Understanding list comprehensions and simple algorithms.

If you're learning Python, it's a great bite-sized project to play around with and tweak.
